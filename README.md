# gym-website
Built a multi-paged, interactive website that enables users to build a personalised fitness programme that suits their schedule.
It allows the user to select the days of the week they would like to train on, as well as how long they would like to spend in the gym.
The website also includes a Gym tips page which contains step-by-step instructions on how to complete exercises, or any other general health and fitness advice.
If the user is unsure of how to perform an exercise in their programme, they can simply press the info button and an image alongside a concise description will appear detailing how to perform the exercise. 
Used a CSS template with additional HTML and CSS for the user interface, and JavaScript for the functionality.
